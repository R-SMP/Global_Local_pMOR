## The files relevant to the study are:
* fem_beam.m, which generates the Timoshenko beam FEM model.
* beam_mor_pmor, which is the actual application of the MOR and pMOR methods on the model.
* beam_mor_pmor, which is equivalent to beam_mor_pmor but focused on the height parameter.
* SO-IRKA-SISO.m, in the soirka folder, which contains slighlty modified implementation of SO-IRKA alogorithm provided by Sebastian.
* irka.m, which contains slightly modified implementation of IRKA algorithm found in Exercise 3.2.
